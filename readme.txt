The directory "src" contains only one files, idct.c, which is
a replacement for the idct.c in lab1. This new version of idct.c
only uses integer arithmetics for idct computation. You can copy
other source files from lab1 to the src directory for lab2. After
that you can build the video decoder program by typing 'make'
under Cygwin. Of course, you will not get correct code unless you
follow the instructions in lab2 to modify the file 'm4v_dec.c'

The timer_example.c is a stand-alone program that shows you how
to install a timer ISR on LEON3 development board. You can build
this program by typing 'make timer_example' under Cygwin.
